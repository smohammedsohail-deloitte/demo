# Azure Front Door Terraform Module

Azure Front Door is a fast, reliable, and secure modern cloud CDN that uses the Microsoft global edge network and integrates with intelligent threat protection. It combines the capabilities of Azure Front Door, Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) standard, and Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) into a single secure cloud CDN platform.

This Terraform module helps create Microsoft's highly available and scalable web application acceleration platform and global HTTP(s) load balancer Azure Front Door Service with Web Application Firewall policies and SSL offloading.

## **`backend_pools`** - Backends and backend pools

A backend pool in Front Door refers to the set of backends that receive similar traffic for their app. In other words, A logical grouping of app instances across the world that receive the same traffic and respond with expected behavior. These backends are deployed across different regions or within the same region. All backends can be in `Active/Active` deployment mode or what is defined as `Active/Passive` configuration. Azure by default allows specifying up to `50` Backend Pools.

Front Door backends refers to the host name or public IP of your application that serves your client requests. Front Door supports both Azure and non-Azure resources in the backend pool. The application can either be in your on-premises datacenter or located in another cloud provider.

`backend_pools` object accepts following argumnets

## **`backend_pool_health_probes`** - Health probes

To determine the health and proximity of each backend for a given Front Door environment, each Front Door environment periodically sends a synthetic HTTP/HTTPS request to each of your configured backends. Front Door then uses these responses from the probe to determine the "best" backend resources to route your client requests.

> For lower load and cost on your backends, Front Door recommends using `HEAD` requests for health probes.

`backend_pool_health_probes` object accepts following argumnets

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                         |

| `path`                | The path to use for the Health Probe. Default is `/`.                                                                                               |

## **`backend_pool_load_balancing`** - settings for the backend pools

Load-balancing settings for the backend pool define how we evaluate health probes. These settings determine if the backend is healthy or unhealthy. They also check how to load-balance traffic between different backends in the backend pool. The following settings are available for `backend_pool_load_balancing` object:

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `additional_latency_milliseconds` | The additional latency in milliseconds for probes to fall into the lowest latency bucket. Defaults to `0`. |

## **`frontend_endpoints`** - Adding Custom Domains and SSL Offloading

The frontend host specifies a desired subdomain on Front Door's default domain i.e. azurefd.net to route traffic from that host via Front Door. You can optionally onboard custom domains as well.

Before you can use a custom domain with your Front Door, you must first create a canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider to point to your Front Door's default frontend host (say contoso.azurefd.net). A custom domain and its subdomain can be associated with only a single Front Door at a time. The following settings are available for `frontend_endpoints` object:

| Name                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                          |

| `host_name`                               | Specifies the host name of the frontend_endpoint. Must be a domain name. In order to use a `name.azurefd.net` domain, the name value must match the Front Door name. |
| `session_affinity_enabled`                | Whether to allow session affinity on this host. Valid options are true or false Defaults to false.                                                                   |
| `session_affinity_ttl_seconds`            | The TTL to use in seconds for session affinity, if applicable. Defaults to 0.                                                                                        |
| `web_application_firewall_policy_link_id` | Defines the Web Application Firewall policy ID for each host. By default pickup existing WAF policy if specified with module.                                        |
| `custom_https_configuration`              | The `custom_https_configuration` block supports the following                                                                                                        |

| `azure_key_vault_certificate_secret_version` | The version of the Key Vault secret representing the full certificate PFX. Defaults to Latest. Only valid if `certificate_source` is set to `AzureKeyVault` |

## **`routing_rules`** - How requests are matched to a routing rule

After establishing a connection and completing a TLS handshake, when a request lands on a Front Door environment one of the first things that Front Door does is determine which particular routing rule to match the request to and then take the defined action in the configuration.

A Front Door routing rule configuration is composed of two major parts: a "left-hand side" and a "right-hand side". We match the incoming request to the left-hand side of the route while the right-hand side defines how we process the request. The following settings are available for `routing_rules` object:

| Name                 | Description                                                                                             |

| `frontend_endpoints` | The names of the `frontend_endpoint` blocks within this resource to associate with this `routing_rule`. |
| `accepted_protocols` | Protocol schemes to match for the Backend Routing Rule. Defaults to `Http`.                             |
| `patterns_to_match`  | The route patterns for the Backend Routing Rule. Defaults to `/*`.                                      |

## Recommended naming and tagging conventions

Applying tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name `Environment` and the value `Production` to all the resources in production.
For recommendations on how to implement a tagging strategy, see Resource naming and tagging decision guide.

> **Important** :
> Tag names are case-insensitive for operations. A tag with a tag name, regardless of the casing, is updated or retrieved. However, the resource provider might keep the casing you provide for the tag name. You'll see that casing in cost reports. **Tag values are case-sensitive.**

An effective naming convention assembles resource names by using important resource information as parts of a resource's name. For example, using these [recommended naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#example-names), a public IP resource for a production SharePoint workload is named like this: `pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001`.
